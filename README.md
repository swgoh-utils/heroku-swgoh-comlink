# Deploy SWGOH Comlink to Heroku
This repo is used to create a quick and easy way to deploy and update SWGOH Comlink on Heroku using GitHub.

Visit the main [SWGOH Comlink repo](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/swgoh-comlink) to learn more about what SWGOH Comlink is and how to use it.

### Heroku limitations
The free version of Heroku is limited on how much data it can deliver at one time. This means you will have to _request the localization file in zip format_ from the `/localization` endpoint and you must request information from the `/data` endpoint _in segments_, prefereably with `includePveUnits` set to false.

You only get 500 hours for using SWGOH Comlink each month, you must add a credit card to your account to increase it to 900 hours which would allow for it to run 24/7 if needed.

### Comlink limitations
In order to calculate stats for player rosters you must use the roster data with [SWGOH Stats](https://gitlab.com/swgoh-tools/swgoh-stats) which may need to be hosted on a separate Heroku account. You can use the following link to quickly set it up on Heroku: [swgoh-utils/heroku-swgoh-stats](https://github.com/swgoh-utils/heroku-swgoh-stats).
